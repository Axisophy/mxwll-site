### Opening

Our work falls into three areas, which are often combined in a single project.
Pricing is by project rather than day rate. We don't publish prices because
scope varies substantially — a short editorial piece and a multi-month research
communication programme have very different requirements.

---

### Science visualisation and interactive explanation

We build interactive data visualisations, real-time scientific simulations,
and exploratory tools that let audiences engage with complex phenomena directly.

This includes everything from standalone interactive pieces — gravitational wave
detectors, stellar catalogues, orbital mechanics simulations — to integrated
data experiences that pull live data from scientific sources and render it in
real time.

The work is technically built in-house, not contracted out. The advantage of
this is that the design and the engineering are developed together rather than
handed off — which matters enormously for interactive explanation, where the
constraints of what is possible technically should inform the explanation
strategy from the start, not arrive as a surprise at the end.

*Appropriate for: research institutions needing public-facing interactive
content, science museums developing permanent or temporary exhibitions,
publishers building digital counterparts to print work, organisations
communicating complex scientific or technical findings to non-specialist
audiences.*

### Scientific illustration and explanation design

Structured explanation built around our methodology — taking a complex
mechanism, process, or system and making it genuinely comprehensible
to a defined audience.

This includes scientific illustration, information graphics, explanation
sequences, and the full seven-stage explanation arc applied to a subject.
It can be print, digital, or both.

The illustration capability here is meaningful: we can work in areas where
the data does not yet exist, or where the phenomenon cannot be charted because
it is structural or mechanistic. Illustration and data visualisation are treated
as continuous disciplines, not separate ones, because cognitively they are.

We also offer **explanation audits**: a structured assessment of existing
communication material — a paper, a website, a presentation, an exhibition —
against the explanation methodology. This identifies the specific places where
the explanation is failing and why, and recommends targeted improvements.
Audits are often the fastest route to significantly improved communication for
organisations with existing assets.

*Appropriate for: research institutions preparing public engagement content,
REF impact case studies, or grant communication; publishers developing
explanation sequences for scientific or technical books; organisations whose
existing communication consistently fails to land with non-specialist audiences.*

### Design systems and pictogram design

Systems that allow organisations to produce consistent, explanation-quality
visual communication at scale.

This includes data design systems (governing how charts, maps, and data
representations are formatted and styled), pictogram and symbol sets (custom
icon systems for publications, wayfinding, and information design), and
explanation templates applicable consistently across a body of work.

The value of a design system for explanation work specifically is that the
cognitive load considerations — hierarchy, colour use, typographic scale,
information density — are resolved once and then applied consistently, rather
than renegotiated on every piece.

*Appropriate for: publishers producing multi-volume or multi-format scientific
reference works; research institutions producing regular public communication;
organisations needing to produce large volumes of data-driven communication
with consistent quality.*

### Starting a conversation

If you have a project in mind — or a communication problem you are not sure
how to approach — the best starting point is a brief description of the
audience, the material, and what you need the audience to be able to do or
understand afterwards. From there we can usually tell quickly whether we are
the right fit, and if so, what the shape of the engagement might be.

*We work with a small number of clients at a time. If you are considering a
project for later in the year, it is worth making contact early.*
