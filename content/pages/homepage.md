# HOMEPAGE — Copy and Hero Visual Brief
# Status: PENDING — hero visual decision not yet made. Do not implement.
# Agents: Do not touch the homepage without explicit instruction.

## Decision pending

The homepage hero visual is under discussion. Options:
1. Video loop — demo recording of a working visualiser (chart of nuclides, morphogenesis, flow fields)
2. Static image — strong single frame from portfolio work

Current direction: **video loop**. Visualiser to be decided once demo recording capability confirmed.

**Do not implement the homepage hero until the video file exists and Simon has approved it.**

## Approved homepage copy (everything except hero)

### Headline (above fold)
Science visualisation and explanation design

### Subhead
We make complex things visible — through interactive visualisation,
illustration, and systematic design.

### Tagline / descriptor (smaller, below)
MXWLL is a studio for science, data, and the complex.
We don't simplify. We clarify.

---

### Below-fold intro (brief)

Most explanation fails not because the designer lacks skill, but because
they have forgotten what it is like not to understand. We start with the
information gap — what your audience already knows versus what they need to —
and design the shortest path between those two states.

Have something complex to communicate?

We work with research institutions, publishers, museums, and organisations
who need to make difficult ideas clear. Start with a conversation.

## Notes

- "We don't simplify. We clarify." should appear somewhere prominent on homepage
- Work section: minimum 4 cards for MVP. Cards use static poster images, not live interactives.
- No testimonials on homepage for MVP — add in v2 when there are real client quotes
- The methodology link is important — it is the main conversion path for the right clients
