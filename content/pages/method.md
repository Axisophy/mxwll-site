### Opening

The problem with most science communication isn't the design. It's the thinking
before the design.

Most visualisations fail not because the charts are wrong, but because nobody
asked the right questions first. What does this audience already know? What is
the single most surprising thing in this data? What does someone need to
understand before they can understand the main point? Where does their
attention go when they first see the page?

These are questions about cognition, not aesthetics. And answering them well
requires understanding both the science and the science of understanding.

### The curse of knowledge

In 1990, a Stanford psychology student ran a simple experiment. She tapped the
rhythm of well-known songs with her finger and asked listeners to identify them.
The tappers predicted others would recognise 50% of songs. The actual rate was
2.5%.

The tappers could hear the music in their heads. Their listeners heard only
irregular knocking.

This is the curse of knowledge — the better you understand something, the
harder it becomes to remember what it was like not to understand it. The
intermediate steps disappear from conscious awareness. Experts skip them
without realising, and audiences are left with the knocking.

The problem compounds in science communication because the knowledge gap is
often not just large but invisible. A researcher presenting climate data to
policymakers, or a biotech explaining a mechanism of action to investors, is
almost always operating on different ground than their audience — and usually
underestimates how different.

### The information gap

Curiosity isn't a passive state. It is the felt sense of a gap between what you
know and what you want to know — and it motivates engagement only when closing
the gap feels possible. Too small a gap and there is nothing to learn. Too large
and the audience gives up.

Effective explanation creates the right size of gap, then closes it. This means
establishing what the audience already knows before introducing anything new,
connecting new concepts to existing mental models rather than replacing them,
and revealing complexity progressively rather than all at once.

The seven-stage structure we use for explanation work follows this logic:

**Hook** — a visual or question that creates curiosity before the audience knows
why they should care. Five to ten seconds.

**Anchor** — connection to something the audience already knows. This is not
simplification; it is orientation.

**Foundation** — the core concept, explained with one concrete example at a
level appropriate for the specific audience. Not the full picture. The foothold.

**Build** — progressive complexity across three to five beats, each adding one
layer. The audience can see where they are in the structure.

**Reward** — consolidation. The moment the pieces come together. Now you see it.

**Extend** — clearly flagged deeper material for those who want it.

**Launch** — pathways to further exploration, follow-up action, or application.

This is a framework, not a formula. Different subjects, different audiences, and
different formats weight the stages differently. Some work needs only four;
some needs all seven run twice.

### How the mind receives information

Working memory is the bottleneck of understanding. When material is genuinely
unfamiliar, it holds roughly three to five items — sometimes as few as three.
This is not a limitation to design around; it is a fact to design from.

It means one new concept per unit of time. It means pre-attentive features
(position, colour, size) should carry the most critical information because
they are processed in under half a second before conscious attention engages.
It means animation helps when it shows a process that unfolds over time, and
hinders when it creates motion where stillness would serve comparison better.
It means interactive elements should guide attention, not just offer a sandbox.

It also means expertise reversal is real: the instructional approach that works
for a novice actively interferes with an expert. There is no single optimal
explanation. Different audiences require fundamentally different work.

---

### What this changes

A consequence of taking cognitive science seriously is that the strategy of a
piece — which concepts to surface first, what to leave out, how long each
section earns — becomes as important as the execution. Beautiful, technically
accomplished work can still fail its audience completely if the structure is
wrong.

This is why we start every project with an explanation audit. We map the
knowledge state of the target audience, identify the key misconceptions that
need to be cleared before the central ideas land, and determine what the
audience needs to be able to do or think differently at the end. Only then do
we decide what form the work takes.

### On interactivity

The best interactive work is not a graphic that the reader can prod, but a
model of a system that the reader can explore — adjusting assumptions, watching
consequences update, building intuition about how the parts relate. It requires
deliberate guidance, not just freedom. It must be readable without interaction
for those who want to read first. And it must make the underlying model visible,
not hide it behind an interface.

Not everything should be interactive. Many of the most powerful pieces of
explanation design are still. Movement earns its place only when the phenomenon
being explained genuinely unfolds over time.

---

### On illustration

Data visualisation and scientific illustration are often treated as separate
disciplines. They are not. The same cognitive principles govern both. The same
hierarchy of perceptual accuracy applies. The difference is that illustration
allows precision where no data exists — representing a mechanism, a structure,
a process that cannot be charted because it is not yet measured.

For research on the frontier, illustration is often more honest than charts.
And the combination of rigorous illustration with interactive data can say
things that neither achieves alone.

---

### Closing

Every project we take on involves the full methodology — from explanation
audit to final output. We don't offer parts of this. If you want only the
visual execution, there are faster options. We work best with organisations
who want the thinking as well as the making.

## Notes for implementation

- Seven-stage arc could be formatted as a definition list or a numbered list
  with description — ask Simon for preference
- "Now you see it" in the Reward section should probably be italicised
- No pull quotes — this page reads as a continuous essay
- Consider a subtle visual separator between major sections
