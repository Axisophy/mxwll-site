### Studio

MXWLL is a science visualisation and explanation design studio. We work with
research institutions, publishers, science museums, and organisations who need
to make difficult ideas genuinely clear — not simplified, but made accessible
without being made wrong.

The work spans interactive data visualisation, scientific illustration, and
structured explanation design. Sometimes these are combined in a single project.
Often the most effective work integrates all three.

### The studio

Simon Tyler founded MXWLL after a decade working at the intersection of
scientific illustration, data visualisation, systems design, and writing.
The studio is based in East Sussex, UK.

The background is unusual, and deliberately so. Most data visualisation studios
are built from design or engineering. MXWLL is built from both, plus a genuine
interest in science and a decade of practice in explaining complex things to
general audiences through books.

The books matter because explanation is a craft that requires iteration and
feedback over time, not a style applied to a brief. Writing — and specifically
writing about technical subjects for non-specialist readers — builds a different
kind of understanding than design practice alone. It forces the question: what
does this audience actually need to know? What can be left out? What is the
essential structure of this idea? These are the same questions that drive
good explanation design.

The technical depth matters because subject understanding shapes what questions
get asked. A designer who understands the physics can ask whether the chart is
actually representing the phenomenon correctly. A designer who understands
genetics can identify when a simplification has become a distortion. This
changes the conversation with scientists and researchers considerably.

### Selected credentials

Scientific illustration and information design for national and international
publishers, science museums, and research institutions.

Author of five books on science, technology, and design subjects, including
*Gizmo: A Visual History of Ingenious Machines* (Thames & Hudson), published
in multiple languages.

Systems design: Network Rail passenger information pictogram system; scientific
poster and publication design systems; Maxwell design system for real-time
scientific data visualisation.

Interactive work includes WebGL-based visualisers for stellar cartography
(50,000 stars from the Gaia catalogue), gravitational wave detection, atomic
structure, orbital mechanics, reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, and flow field
dynamics.

### How we work

Projects begin with a conversation about the explanation problem, not the
visual output. We ask what the audience currently understands, what the most
important thing is that they need to leave with, and what the misconceptions
are that stand between their current understanding and the one you need them
to have.

From that conversation we develop an explanation strategy — a structured
document that maps the information architecture before any design decisions
are made. This is not a deliverable in the traditional agency sense. It is the
thinking that makes the subsequent design work faster, sharper, and more
likely to do what it needs to do.

We are a small studio. We take on a limited number of projects each year,
and we work directly with the people who commission us rather than through
account management layers. If you are working with MXWLL, you are working
with Simon.

### What we don't do

We don't do dashboards, business intelligence, or data analytics visualisation.
Those are important disciplines; they are simply not ours.

We don't produce quick-turnaround infographics. Our method requires time at
the strategy stage, and skipping that stage produces work we would not stand
behind.

We don't simplify. We clarify. These are different things. Simplification
removes complexity; clarification makes complexity navigable. The science
stays accurate.

## Notes for implementation

- The credentials section could be formatted differently — Simon to decide
  whether books warrant their own more prominent mention (given author identity)
- "Maxwell design system" reference — Simon to decide whether to name Maxwell
  here now the brand has changed, or replace with different wording
- Photo of Simon: needed before this page goes live
- Keep the "what we don't do" section — it is a differentiator
