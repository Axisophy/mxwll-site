# MXWLL Voice and Tone
# Read before writing or editing any copy.

---

## Core Voice

**Authoritative without being academic.**
**Precise without being dry.**
**Lead with the interesting thing, not the preamble.**

MXWLL writes like a scientist who can also write — someone who understands the
material deeply and respects the reader's intelligence without condescension.
The tone is confident but not self-promotional. It earns its claims through
specificity rather than assertion.

---

## Always

- British English: colour, realise, programme, whilst, organisation
- Active voice wherever possible
- Short sentences alongside longer ones — vary the rhythm
- Specific over vague: "50,000 stars from the Gaia catalogue" not "a large star dataset"
- Lead with the observation, phenomenon, or problem — not the solution or service
- End sections with something that earns the reader continuing

---

## Never

**Forbidden words and phrases — do not use under any circumstances:**
- innovative / cutting-edge / state-of-the-art
- leverage (as a verb)
- synergy / synergistic
- disrupt / disruptive
- stakeholder
- solution (unless referring to a chemical solution)
- utilize (use "use")
- amazing / incredible / stunning (in copy about our own work)
- game-changing / best-in-class / world-class
- deliverable (use "work", "piece", "output")
- seamless / intuitive / user-friendly
- empower / enable (as marketing verbs)
- journey (in a business context)

**Structural prohibitions:**
- No em dashes. Use a hyphen or restructure the sentence.
- No exclamation marks in professional copy.
- Do not open with "We are..." or "MXWLL is..." if avoidable — lead with the idea.
- Do not use rhetorical questions as section openers more than once per page.
- No bullet points in narrative sections — write prose.

## Register by Context

**Method page:** Most intellectual. Cognitive science framing. Can use technical
terms (working memory, pre-attentive processing) — but always explain them.
Reads like a short essay, not a process document.

**About page:** Personal but not casual. First person singular where appropriate
("Simon Tyler founded..."). Specific credentials, not vague positioning claims.

**Services page:** Functional but not corporate. Describes what each service
actually involves and who it is for. No hype. No bullet-pointed feature lists.

**Work pages:** Let the work lead. Minimal copy. Context, problem, approach.
Precise description of what the piece does and why it is structured that way.

**Homepage:** Tightest writing on the site. Every word earns its place.
Not a summary of everything — one clear proposition.

## Tone Examples

### Wrong
> We leverage cutting-edge visualisation technology to deliver innovative,
> world-class science communication solutions that empower your stakeholders
> to engage with your research in an intuitive way.

### Right
> Most explanation fails not because the designer lacks skill, but because
> nobody asked what the audience currently understands before deciding
> what to show them.

---

### Wrong
> Our amazing team of experts creates stunning interactive experiences!

### Right
> The work is technically built in-house, not contracted out. The advantage
> is that design and engineering are developed together — which matters for
> interactive explanation, where technical constraints should inform the
> explanation strategy from the start.

## On Explanation Design as a Term

Use it. It is accurate and it is ours.
But earn it through demonstration rather than declaration.
The Method page explains it. The work demonstrates it.
The homepage and about page use it as a descriptor, not a selling point.
