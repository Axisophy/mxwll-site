positioning_statement: >
  MXWLL is a science visualisation and explanation design studio.
  We work with research institutions, publishers, science museums, and organisations
  who need to make difficult ideas genuinely clear — not simplified, but made
  accessible without being made wrong.

what_we_do:
  - Interactive data visualisation and scientific simulation
  - Scientific illustration and explanation design
  - Design systems and pictogram design for scientific communication

what_we_dont_do:
  - Business intelligence and dashboard work
  - Quick-turnaround infographics
  - Generic data visualisation without explanation strategy
  - Work for clients who want aesthetics without the underlying thinking

the_gap_we_occupy: >
  Most data visualisation studios produce work that impresses. We produce work
  that explains. The distinction matters: a viewer can leave impressive work not
  understanding it. Our work is designed to close that gap.
  No competitor combines science depth + illustration capability +
  cognitive science methodology + interactive/technical execution.

key_differentiators:
  - Genuine subject matter depth — can engage with the science, not just the data
  - Illustration ability — can represent mechanisms and structures where no data exists
  - Explanation methodology grounded in cognitive science research
  - Full technical stack — design and engineering developed together, not handed off
  - Published author credentials proving explanation capability at book length
  - Maxwell platform — evidence of complex real-time data system capability

target_clients:
  primary:
    - Research institutions (UK REF impact requirements create strong need)
    - Science museums and exhibition designers
    - STEM publishers (Pearson, OUP, Cambridge, MIT Press)
  secondary:
    - Corporate science/tech (biotech, medtech, climate tech)
    - Editorial (New Scientist, Wired, Nature)

pricing_approach: >
  Project-based. No public pricing. Quote based on scope.
  Day rate equivalent: £600-900. Projects: £3k-30k depending on type.
  Do not mention specific prices in any public-facing copy.

  closest_competitors:
    - name: "Fathom Information Design"
      gap: "Science depth but no explanation methodology, less illustration"
    - name: "Moritz Stefaner / Truth & Beauty"
      gap: "Philosophically similar but solo, no methodology page, no illustration"
    - name: "Variable.io"
      gap: "Aesthetic quality but no explanatory intent — work impresses, doesn't explain"
    - name: "The Pudding / Polygraph"
      gap: "Narrative sophistication but culture-focused, no cognitive science methodology"
  quality_benchmark: "Bartosz Ciechanowski (ciechanow.ski) — sets the standard for interactive explanation"
