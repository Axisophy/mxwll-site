# Morphogenesis
**Status:** In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-23
**Location in site:** `/work/morphogenesis`
**Type:** Video + Interactive Visualiser (WebGL)

## What it is
Explainer demonstrating how Turing patterns emerge from reaction-diffusion systems. Shows the Gray-Scott model running in real-time on GPU, illustrating how simple chemical rules produce complex biological patterns (spots, stripes, spirals).

## Format
- Pre-rendered video (generated from Python/Jupyter notebooks)
- Interactive WebGL2 reaction-diffusion simulation (to be implemented)

## Source generation
**Pre-rendered video**: Source generation code lives in Jupyter notebooks — not in this repo. Python/Jupyter source should be located and documented separately. Likely in `/projects/Bang-Reaction-Diffusion/` directory.

**Interactive component**: WebGL2-based Gray-Scott model simulator (placeholder present, needs implementation).

## Current state
- Page structure complete with content
- Video placeholder present (needs actual video file)
- Interactive visualiser is placeholder only (needs WebGL implementation)
- Target: Real-time GPU simulation with user-adjustable feed/kill rates and painting interface
