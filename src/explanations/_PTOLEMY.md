# Ptolemy Creative Engine

A standalone desktop app (Tauri + Python backend) for generating mathematical art - strange attractors, fractals, algorithmic visualisations. This is the canonical tool for generating source material for pre-rendered explanation pieces.

Source videos/images for pieces in src/explanations/ may originate from Ptolemy. When documenting an explanation piece, note whether its source assets were generated via Ptolemy or standalone Jupyter notebooks (the goal is to migrate all notebook-based generation into Ptolemy over time).

Ptolemy is a separate repo/project - not part of mxwll-site.

**Note:** See Ptolemy repo for plugin architecture and implementation details.
