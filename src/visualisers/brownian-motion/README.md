# Brownian Motion
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Simulation of Brownian motion showing random thermal collisions and resulting random-walk trajectories. Includes historical framing around Einstein's 1905 atomic-theory evidence.

## How to run / develop
Planned as a Canvas 2D dual-view simulation with microscale collisions in `core/`, autoplay narrative in `demo/`, and parameter controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No simulation implementation yet.
