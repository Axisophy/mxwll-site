# Chladni Figures
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Simulation of Chladni plate nodal patterns where virtual sand accumulates at vibration nodes and clears from antinodes, producing symmetric resonant geometries. Includes an optional sound-reactive mode driven by microphone input.

## How to run / develop
Planned structure keeps mode maths and particle dynamics in `core/`, autonomous presentation in `demo/`, and mode selection plus controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No mode solver, sand particle engine, or audio-reactive pipeline implemented yet.
