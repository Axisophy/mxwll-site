# Tectonic Drift
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Voronoi-based tectonic plate drift simulation from Pangea to present with optional forward projections toward future supercontinent scenarios.

## How to run / develop
Planned architecture uses `core/` for globe rendering and plate interpolation, `demo/` for guided timeline playback, and `interactive/` for time scrubbing and overlays.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No plate model or timeline renderer implemented yet.
