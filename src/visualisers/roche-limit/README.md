**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Simulation of a moon approaching a planet and disintegrating into a ring system when tidal forces exceed self-gravity.

## How to run / develop
Planned architecture keeps particle simulation and force computation in `core/`, narrative playback in `demo/`, and control tooling in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No simulation implementation yet.
