# The Extraction Map - Specification

**Status:** Not yet written (migration incomplete)
**Created:** 2026-02-24

To be filled in when migration is complete. See maxwell-archived-2026-02 source code for implementation details.

## Placeholder Notes

**Brief:** Interactive Mapbox globe showing ~100+ major mining operations and extraction sites worldwide. Material filtering, supply chain concentration data, and narrative sections about phones, EVs, energy transition, and ocean mining.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Mapbox GL for geographic credibility (not simplified SVG)
- Material-based filtering (click lithium → see all lithium mines)
- Narrative product sections ("What's in your phone") with interactive material selection
- Supply concentration charts (which countries dominate each material)
- Ocean mining as speculative future section

**Data Sources:**
- USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries
- S&P Global Market Intelligence
- Company reports for major mines
- Curated ~100 sites representing global extraction geography

Full specification to be written during migration.
