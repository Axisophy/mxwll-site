## Placeholder Desktop Demo Sequence

**Duration:** 45-60 seconds

1. **Global View** (0-10s): Show full world map with all mines visible
2. **Lithium Triangle** (10-25s): Zoom to Chile/Bolivia/Argentina → highlight lithium mines
3. **DRC Cobalt** (25-40s): Fly to Democratic Republic of Congo → highlight cobalt mines
4. **Chinese Rare Earths** (40-55s): Fly to China → highlight rare earth deposits
5. **Return to Global** (55-60s): Zoom out to show global distribution

## Placeholder Mobile Demo

**Recommended:** Static map view at global scale, no autonomous camera movement. Simplified UI, no flyTo animations.

**Reason:** Mapbox 3D globe + camera animations can be heavy on mobile. Better to show static educational view.
