**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Animated phyllotaxis pattern showing plant seed packing from the golden angle (137.5 degrees) and its relation to Fibonacci spirals.

## How to run / develop
Planned as a lightweight Canvas 2D visualiser with seed-placement core in `core/`, autoplay sequence in `demo/`, and angle controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No simulation implementation yet.
