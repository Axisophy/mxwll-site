# Known Issues

## Open
- This visualiser shares code and data assumptions with Stellar Cartography; architecture decision needed on extension vs separate implementation.
- Long-range time extrapolation can amplify catalogue noise and measurement uncertainty.
- Constellation overlay definitions need curation to avoid clutter in dense regions.

## Resolved
- None yet.
