# Fourier Epicycles
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Interactive Fourier epicycle drawing machine. It decomposes any 2D path into rotating circles using the Discrete Fourier Transform, then animates the drawing machine as epicycles trace the original shape.

## How to run / develop
Planned as a visualiser module under `src/visualisers/fourier-epicycles/` with shared maths and rendering in `core/`, autonomous loop in `demo/`, and user controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No rendering, controls, or Fourier maths implementation yet.

## Audience
General audience. Strong candidate for intuitive demonstrations of the DFT.
