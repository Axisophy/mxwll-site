# Known Issues

## Open
- User-drawn inputs can be noisy and may require path smoothing or resampling to avoid unstable reconstructions.
- Frequency labels may overlap at high circle counts and need adaptive visibility rules.
- Very detailed paths may require aggressive coefficient limits on mobile to hold frame rate.

## Resolved
- None yet.
