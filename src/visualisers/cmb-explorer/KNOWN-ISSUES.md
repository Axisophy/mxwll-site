# Known Issues

## Open
- HEALPix FITS processing requires a Python preprocessing pipeline (`healpy`).
- Preprocessing must complete before browser rendering.
- "Your patch" date-to-sky algorithm still needs formal definition.
- Full-resolution Planck maps are large and require tiling or level-of-detail strategy.

## Resolved
- None yet.
