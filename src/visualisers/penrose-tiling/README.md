**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Aperiodic Penrose tiling generator showing non-repeating planar coverage from simple local tile rules.

## How to run / develop
Planned as Canvas 2D or SVG with deflation rules in `core/`, autoplay growth in `demo/`, and navigation controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No tiling engine implementation yet.
