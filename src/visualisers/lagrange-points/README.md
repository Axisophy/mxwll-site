# Lagrange Points
**Status:** Not started

## What it is
Gravitational potential landscape of two-body systems (Earth-Sun or Earth-Moon) showing L1-L5 equilibria in rotating frame coordinates, with particles settling around stable points.

## How to run / develop
Planned architecture uses `core/` for potential field and particle flow, `demo/` for guided walkthroughs, and `interactive/` for system and parameter controls.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No potential solver or particle flow implementation yet.
