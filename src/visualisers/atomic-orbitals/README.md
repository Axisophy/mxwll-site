# Atomic Orbitals
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Volume rendering of hydrogen orbital probability density clouds for s, p, d, and f orbitals. Replaces planetary-orbit misconceptions with quantum probability fields.

## How to run / develop
Planned structure uses `core/` for orbital maths and volume rendering, `demo/` for curated learning sequence, and `interactive/` for selection and controls.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No orbital field renderer implemented yet.
