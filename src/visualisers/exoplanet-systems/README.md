**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Interactive orrery of real exoplanet systems using NASA Exoplanet Archive data, with TRAPPIST-1 as the feature case for compact resonant multi-planet architecture.

## How to run / develop
Planned split uses `core/` for orbital rendering and catalogue transforms, `demo/` for autonomous show mode, and `interactive/` for filtering and educational controls.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No orbital renderer, catalogue browser, or data ingestion pipeline implemented yet.

## Data source
NASA Exoplanet Archive (`exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu`).
