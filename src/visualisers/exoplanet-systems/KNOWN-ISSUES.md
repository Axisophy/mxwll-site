# Known Issues

## Open
- Real orbital distances make TRAPPIST-1 planets visually crowded, so artistic scaling may be required.
- Rendering full 5,000+ planet catalogue requires performance profiling and level-of-detail planning.
- Archive fields are heterogeneous across discoveries and will need data cleaning rules.

## Resolved
- None yet.
