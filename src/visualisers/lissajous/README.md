# Lissajous
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Lissajous curves and harmonograph simulation. Parametric curves emerge from combining sinusoidal motions at different frequency ratios and phase offsets, with optional damping to mimic physical harmonograph behaviour.

## How to run / develop
Planned as a Canvas 2D visualiser with curve generation in `core/`, autonomous showcase in `demo/`, and live controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No curve renderer, parameter controls, or harmonograph damping implementation yet.
