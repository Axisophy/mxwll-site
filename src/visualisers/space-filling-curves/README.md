# Space-Filling Curves
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Animated construction of Hilbert, Peano, and Moore space-filling curves, showing recursive subdivision and how a 1D path can progressively fill a 2D region.

## How to run / develop
Planned as a recursion-driven Canvas 2D or SVG visualiser with generators in `core/`, autonomous recursion showcase in `demo/`, and user controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No curve generator, recursion animator, or mapping mode implementation yet.
