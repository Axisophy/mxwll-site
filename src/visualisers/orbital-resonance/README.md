# Orbital Resonance
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Visualisation of orbital resonance where simple integer period ratios produce stable configurations and geometric patterns. Primary anchor is the Galilean 1:2:4 chain.

## Focus
Jupiter's Galilean moons: Io, Europa, and Ganymede.

## How to run / develop
Planned as a Canvas 2D system with orbital timing maths in `core/`, autoplay showcases in `demo/`, and ratio controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No renderer or controls implemented yet.
