# Known Issues

## Open
- Maintaining 60fps on mobile may require lower simulation resolution and fewer active sources.
- Stable boundary conditions for slit and cavity presets need careful tuning to avoid numerical artefacts.
- Touch input density can generate too many sources without throttling.

## Resolved
- None yet.
