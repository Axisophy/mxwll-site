# Wave Tank
**Status:** Not started

**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Interactive 2D wave simulation where users create wave sources and observe interference, diffraction, and reflection in real time. Built to demonstrate superposition as an immediately visible physical principle.

## How to run / develop
Planned structure keeps GPU wave solver and field state in `core/`, autonomous preset cycles in `demo/`, and user controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No shader simulation, interaction layer, or preset engine implemented yet.
