# Neuronal Firing
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
3D neural network simulation showing action potential propagation as travelling pulses over synaptic links.

## Target audience
Biotech and medtech clients, neuroscience researchers, and general audience learning contexts.

## How to run / develop
Planned architecture keeps graph generation and dynamics in `core/`, autoplay narrative in `demo/`, and user controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No network renderer or propagation model implemented yet.
