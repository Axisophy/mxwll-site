# Double Pendulum
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Simulation of many double pendulums with tiny differences in starting conditions, showing sensitive dependence on initial conditions and rapid chaotic divergence.

## How to run / develop
Planned as a Canvas 2D system with RK4 integration in `core/`, autonomous divergence loop in `demo/`, and adjustable controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No physics integration, rendering, or controls implemented yet.
