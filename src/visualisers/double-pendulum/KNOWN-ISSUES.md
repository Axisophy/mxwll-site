# Known Issues

## Open
- Chaotic systems are sensitive to timestep and floating-point precision, requiring careful tuning.
- Rendering 50 pendulum trails plus phase space can drop frame rate on low-end mobile devices.
- Synchrony metric definition must be robust and visually meaningful across parameter ranges.

## Resolved
- None yet.
