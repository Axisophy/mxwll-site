# Boids
**Status:** Not started
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24
**Location in site:** Lab

## What it is
Craig Reynolds-style flocking simulation where separation, alignment, and cohesion rules produce emergent group motion with no central controller.

## How to run / develop
Planned architecture keeps agent update logic in `core/`, autonomous preset playback in `demo/`, and interactive rule controls in `interactive/`.

## Current state
Scaffold complete. No boid solver, renderer, or preset system implemented yet.
