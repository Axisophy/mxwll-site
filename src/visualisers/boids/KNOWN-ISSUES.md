# Known Issues

## Open
- Naive neighbour search scales poorly and may not hold 5,000 agents without spatial acceleration.
- Predator interactions can destabilise flocks if rule weighting is not carefully constrained.
- High-density scenes can become visually noisy without trail and opacity controls.

## Resolved
- None yet.
